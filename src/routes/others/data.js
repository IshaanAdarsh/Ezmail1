			'<p> <strong>Subject</strong>: Request for office hours this Friday <br>Dear Prof. <br>Reang, My name is Human Cat. I am a third-year undergraduate student studying EE. I am writing to you to know about your availability this Friday. I am enrolled in your course XYZ69A, and did not quite understand the part where you explained about "how people are mean and terrible" in the last lecture. I was wondering if it would be possible to come to your office during the office hours and get the doubt clarified. I would be grateful to you if you can explain the concept to me once again. <br>Thank you. I look forward to hearing from you. <br>Sincerely,<br>Human Cat<br> 170228, BT-EE </p>'
